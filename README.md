Experimenting with Facebook SDK for PHP

This is a simple script that will fetch your FB statuses using FB SDK for JavaScript.

#####Installation

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/ndamnjanovic/facebook-php-js
$ cd node-jira
$ npm install
```

#####Requirements
This script is using Sass for styling layout, and Gulp for compiling those Sass files into Css.
Also, in order to use it, you need to create an application on Facebook, that will communicate with this script.
